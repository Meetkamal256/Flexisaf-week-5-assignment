# React Hooks Demo

This project demonstrates the usage of **React Hooks** such as `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and a **custom hook** to manage states, side effects, and direct DOM manipulation in a React functional component.

The app has:
1. **User Input Section** with `useState`
2. **Counter Section** using both `useState` and a custom hook
3. **Document Title Update** with `useEffect`
4. **Focus Input** using `useRef`

## Project Overview

In this demo, we build a simple React app that covers:
- **State Management**: Handling user input and counter states.
- **Side Effects**: Updating the document title based on the state.
- **Refs**: Directly interacting with DOM elements to manipulate focus.
